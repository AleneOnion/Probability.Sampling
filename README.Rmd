# Probability.Sampling

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Probability.Sampling is to analyze the results of NYS random probabilistic sampling and contextualize them within the EPA's National Lake Assessment results. All scripts use EPA's spsurvey package.

## List of files

The results are knitted from Rmarkdowns into HTML files

- <b>Probability.Results.2021</b>: NYS results estimations across NYS nutrient thresholds, CSLAP thresholds, NLA thresholds and comparison against LMAS results.

- <b>Probability.Results.NLA</b>: NLA Northern Appalachian region results estimations across NYS nutrient thresholds and NLA thresholds, compared against NY probability sampling and LMAS results.

- <b>Probability.Results.NLA.NYS.2021</b>: NLA national results estimations across NYS nutrient thresholds and NLA thresholds, compared against Northern Applachian and NY probability sampling results.

- <b>Probability.Results.Excursions</b>: NYS probability sampling results estimate of “excursions” from NY StayCALM water quality standards for fishing use (ammonia, dissolved oxygen, nitrite, pH).

## Thresholds
